            </h2>
            <p>
              YOUB integrates with Google Calendar to support training planning
              and schedule synchronization. We use full calendar access (Google
              Calendar full scope) to provide the requested functionality. In
              compliance with the Google API Services User Data Policy, we are
              transparent about how we access, use, store, and share Google user
              data.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">5.1 Data Accessed</h3>
            <p>
              If you explicitly connect your Google account, YOUB may access and
              manage Google Calendar data via the Google Calendar API full
              scope, limited to the minimum necessary to provide calendar
              synchronization. This may include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Calendar metadata (e.g., calendar ID and calendar name)</li>
              <li>
                Calendar events (only event fields required for scheduling and
                synchronization), such as event title/summary, description,
                start time, end time, recurrence information (if applicable),
                and event updates
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              YOUB does <strong>not</strong> access Google data such as emails,
              contacts, files/documents, or any other Google services unrelated
              to calendar scheduling.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">5.2 Data Usage</h3>
            <p>We use Google Calendar data only for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Export training sessions:</strong> Create or update
                planned training sessions from YOUB in your Google Calendar (so
                your training plan appears in your schedule).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Import schedule availability:</strong> Read existing
                calendar events to optimize training planning around your
                availability (e.g., work commitments, travel, appointments).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do <strong>not</strong> use Google Calendar data for
              advertising, profiling, market research, or resale.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">
              5.3 Data Storage, Retention, and Deletion
            </h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>
                Google Calendar data is processed securely and stored only as
                long as necessary to provide the calendar integration features.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can disconnect Google Calendar at any time. After
                disconnection, YOUB no longer accesses your Google Calendar
                data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any stored Google Calendar-related data is deleted upon account
                disconnection or upon your request, unless legal retention
                obligations apply.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">5.4 Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>
              YOUB does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share Google user
              data with third parties. Google user data may be processed by our
              infrastructure providers strictly as needed to operate the service
              (e.g., secure cloud hosting), and only under appropriate
              contractual safeguards (e.g., data processing agreements) and in
              compliance with applicable law.
            </p>

              <strong>Important clarification:</strong> Google user data
              accessed via Google APIs (such as Google Calendar data) is
              <strong>not</strong> used to train, improve, or develop
              generalized AI or machine learning models. Google Calendar data is
              used only to provide the calendar synchronization and scheduling

              ensuring that your data is processed securely and in compliance
              with GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
              We only use processors that provide appropriate technical and

              satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
              Typically, your data will be retained for as long as you use the
